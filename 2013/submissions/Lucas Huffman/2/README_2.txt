WARNING = Although I tried to be less memory intensive, this program still 
caused a pretty big spike in cpu usage and after running it a bunch of times,
my laptop was getting rather warm.

- csc_cont_part2.rb is the submission for Part 1 of the CSC Contest
- The "sequences" folder contains the files provided for the problem (all files
were originally included, but it made the *.zip file too large to email = see
README.txt in the sequences folder)
- dna_results is a dump of the results of csc_cont_part2.rb

- Based on the results of the program, sequences 7 and 43 are the most similar
