- csc_cont_part3.rb = Expresses a given number of primes (provided by user)
greater than 5 and the sum of 3 primes which produces that number.

- csc_cont_part3b.rb = Generates an infinite number of primes using the "sum
of 3 primes" method (although this solution does miss some primes in the 
sequence because it stops at the first combination that provides a prime in
each look)
