A simple `make' will compile two executables: `problem_3_part_a' and `problem_3_part_b'.

Problem 3 part b will keep going forever.

Each part uses the Miller Rabin primality test for generating primes.

Even though it *is* probabilistic, you will need to check approximately one trillion primes before you get a false positive. For more arguments:

Really, a subset of Goldbach's Weak Conjecture. Do you really want the proof?

First, read this:

then this:

and finally, you will be able to understand this:
