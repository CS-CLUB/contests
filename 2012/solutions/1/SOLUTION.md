PROBLEM 1 SOLUTION
==================

The solution is quite simple if you take the time to think it out, you simply have
two loops and for the word specified ensure that for EACH character in the
sentence provided matches each character in the word, if it does return the index
of the outer loop (which is the index of the first character of the word in the
sentence).

This functionality is implemented in many programming languages and libraries, the
exact equivalent solution to this problem is just to use the C library strstr
function.

It was very possible to solve this problem without actually doing any work and
by simply just using the built in string searching/maipulation operations that
just about every programming language has. Although there are much more elegant
solutions such as using look-ahead and other complexity optimal solutions, this
is part of the most creative solution criteria.
