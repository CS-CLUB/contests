Each of the implementations have a run script that can be used to run them.

Some have a compile script that may need to be run first.

You will need:
racket
sbcl
ocaml
g++
ghc (haskell)
python
ruby
perl
javac
scalac
nasm (assembly)

They should all be basic Arch packages --- no AUR needed (I think).

For the assembly version, lines are LF delimited, that is, 0xA delimeted.

For all implementations, the first line of input should consist of a
single word with no spaces, followed by a LF linebreak.

The next line should consist of any ASCII characters, followed by another LF linebreak.

Don't go throwing CR linebreaks at the Assembly version, or something might break.

The assembly version will compile fine on a 64-bit machine.
