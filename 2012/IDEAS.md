CLUB CONTEST PROBLEMS BRAINSTORMING AND IDEAS
=============================================

PROBLEM 1
----------

The string search problem, which will be done similarly to last year's "Huff Puff"
problem. The source of the idea for the problem is taken from a good stack overflow
article on job interview questions.

Since stackoverflow has tyrannical mods and any good questions get removed (above
link is dead) see the following backup of the article:

###The problem description from stackoverflow:

> strstr: find the first location of a string in another string.
> 
> This is a well-known function across many languages, and can be coded in under 
> fifteen lines. (Anything more is too much for a whiteboard.)

> strstr is also perfect because it is just the right level of difficulty: two levels
> of looping. It sounds like it might be too easy, but it will instantly separate 
> those who can code from those who cannot. In fact, maybe only one in five 
> candidates gets it right without help.

	a)  Give some examples such as having to find the index of the word "club" in the sentence 
      "This year's club contest is easy for regular ucsc members!"

	b) 	Similarly to last year, this problem will have two awards which can be used
		  as tie breakers

		I)	Most implementations, 5x number of implementations for assembly
			  give them the link to pcasm book (very strong bias to win)

		II) Most creative implementation
