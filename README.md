Computer Science Club Contests
===============================

Description
-----------

Each year at the end of the fall semester the Computer Science Club at the University of
Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) and Durham College (DC) has an annual contest
consisting of challenging problems that require contestants to think outside the box. There
are no rules, you can solve the problems however you please, the emphasis of the contest is
how you think not what you know.

Prizes
-------

Prizes are an essential aspect of the contest (along with world-wide fame and being the envy of
your peers), each year prizes are awarded for the top three contestants as well as additional prizes
for awards such as most creative solution, most implementations, etc. The prizes are often related to
hacker culture with an emphasis on physical electronic prizes such as Arduinos/Raspberry Pi's and other
interesting kits.
